# SQL-data-Cleaning-Project
Data cleaning using SQL involves a systematic approach to identify and correct errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in a dataset. Here’s an overview of the key steps and concepts involved:

1. Removing Duplicates
Duplicates can skew analysis and should be removed. This involves identifying rows with identical values in specified columns and deleting all but one instance of these duplicates to ensure each record is unique.

2. Handling Missing Values
Handling missing data is crucial as it can affect analysis. Common strategies include:

Imputation: Filling missing values with default values, mean, median, or mode of the column.
Deletion: Removing rows or columns that contain missing values, especially if the missingness is extensive and could affect the integrity of the analysis.
3. Standardizing Formats
Data needs to be in a consistent format. This includes standardizing date formats, converting all text to a uniform case (e.g., all uppercase or all lowercase), and ensuring numeric values are in the correct format.

4. Correcting Data Types
Ensuring each column has the correct data type is crucial. For instance, dates should be stored in date formats, numbers as integers or floats, and text as strings. Correcting data types helps in performing accurate operations and comparisons.

5. Trimming Whitespace
Leading and trailing spaces in text fields can cause errors in string comparisons and indexing. Trimming whitespace ensures that the data is clean and comparisons are accurate.

6. Removing Unwanted Characters
Data might contain unwanted characters that need to be removed. This can include special characters, extra punctuation, or any characters that don’t fit the context of the data.

7. Standardizing Text
Text data should be consistent. This includes converting text to a standard case (either uppercase or lowercase), correcting common misspellings, and ensuring consistent use of abbreviations.
